# lazy-router
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scriptoLLC/lazy-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scriptoLLC/lazy-router)

A client-side router based on [wayfarer](https://github.com/yoshuawyuts/wayfarer)  that allows for lazy-loading of client bundles for routes that might not yet be available.

## Usage
main.js:
```js
const lr = require('lazy-router')
lr('/404') // default route if nothing matches -- this needs to be available on your server!
lr.on('/my-route', (pathname, routeObj) => console.log(pathname, routeObj))
lr.push('/not-loaded-yet')
```

not-loaded-yet.js:
```js
const lr = require('lazy-router')
lr('/404') // arguments in subsequent calls are ignored after the first call
lr.on('/not-loaded-yet', (pathname, routeObj) => console.log('i got lazy loaded'))
```

So long as `not-loaded-yet.js` is served from `/not-loaded-yet/not-loaded-yet.bundle.js`, when
`main.js` receieves a request for `/not-loaded-yet`, it'll load the bundle and then
trigger the route when the bundle is loaded.

## API
#### `const lr = lazyRouter(defaultRoute?: string) -> router`
Create or get the current router instance.  The first time this method is called
you must supply the `defaultRoute` argument. This argument is ignored in subsequent
calls and it will return the already-defined router instance

#### `lr.on(pathname: string, (pathname: string, Location: object, state: object) -> void) -> void`
Attach a route to the router, and provide a function for calling that route. The
router uses [pathname-match](https://github.com/yoshuawyuts/pathname-match) to handle
matching, so any query string, hash, etc on the route will be ignored.

The callback receives three parameters:
* the pathname that was used for the match,
* a [Location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location) object and
* the `state` provided (if any) to the `push` or `replace` method

#### `lr.push(path: string, state: object)`
Push a new URL into the browser history and invoke the handler for this route.
If the route is not available in the current router, this will attempt to
load a new bundle that contains a handler for the route.  If this fails, the
client will attempt to load the route defined in `defaultRoute` from the server.

#### `lr.replace(path: string, state: object)`
Replace the current URL with the new URL provided and invoke the handler for that
route. The same loading rules apply as for `push`

## Singleton
This module attempts to make itself a singleton by attaching its instance to the
`window` object, and then returning that if it exists.  This means no matter
what you're using for bundling, splitting, etc, you should always get a single
instance of this router (so long as the code is all running in the same window)

## TODO
* User definable resolution for missing bundle
* More tests
* Figure out coverage for the iframe
